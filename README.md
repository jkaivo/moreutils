Here, you will find implementations of utilities present in GNU coreutils
that are not part of any version of POSIX.

Most of them are very small shell scripts.

Their existence here is not an endorsement of GNU coreutils or GNU philosophy.
They are intended only to aid in porting software that has unconscious
dependencies on GNUisms and assists users trying to escape the GNU ecosystem.
